About Me

Hello! My name is William, I am a data analyst and aspiring software engineer, currently working towards a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science and a Google Data Analytics Certification. My focus lies in leveraging data to build meaningful models, pipelines, and systems that enhance decision-making and operational efficiency. On this GitHub page, youâ€™ll find some of my recent projects that reflect my passion for data analysis, machine learning, and process automation.

ðŸ“‚ Projects

1. Fraud Detection Model

In this project, I developed a comprehensive fraud detection model that analyzes transaction data to identify potential fraudulent activity. The notebook walks through the process of data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. It showcases the use of various machine learning techniques and highlights the importance of balancing accuracy with recall when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

Key Features:

	â€¢	Data preprocessing and cleaning
	â€¢	Feature engineering
	â€¢	Model evaluation and performance tuning
	â€¢	Integration of fraud detection metrics

You can explore the notebook here.

2. Data Processing Pipeline

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data processing pipeline built for handling and transforming raw data before feeding it into machine learning models. The pipeline is designed to be modular, ensuring easy integration with different datasets and workflows. It also handles feature selection, scaling, and encoding of categorical variables, making it highly flexible for various projects.

Key Features:

	â€¢	Modular pipeline structure
	â€¢	Data transformation and scaling
	â€¢	Categorical feature encoding
	â€¢	Feature selection and extraction

You can explore the pipeline here.

3. Banking dataset
   In this project I cleaned a banking dataset to showcase trends in retaining customers. I started with handling missing values and outliers. Once the data was fully cleaned I used it to make visualizations to showcase the trends potential stakeholders would be  interested in. My next steps will including additional data from a second dataset and making a digital dashboard.

ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next?

Iâ€™m continuously adding new projects as I advance my learning in machine learning, cloud computing, and systems integration. A few things I have in the works now are a NFL statistic prediction model capable of prediction fantasy scores and upcoming games using data from previous seasons. Ive included injuries, statidiums and weather. Im currently in the final stages of training. I am also working on a Loan Default dataset. The dataset is completed and I am building some vizualizations. Stay tuned for more updates, including my upcoming work and feel free to give any feedback as Im always open to learning new and more efficient ways to complete these projects.
